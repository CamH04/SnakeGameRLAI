torch: a deep learning framework
random: Used for prng
numpy as np: Makes ints in python not be ridiculous
collections (deque): A double-ended queue used to store the agent's experience for efficient memory management.
game (SnakeGameAI, Direction, Point): Contains custom classes from the game.py module to represent the snake game environment, directions, and points (coordinates).
model (Linear_QNet, QTrainer): Custom classes within the model.py module define the Q-learning neural network and training logic.
helper (plot): Defines functions within the helper.py module for plotting the training progress.
